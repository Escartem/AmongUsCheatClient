## Among Us Cheat Client
> ### This is a simple cheat client for Among Us made in C++ and python

This is made for educational purposes only

# :warning:I have decided to archive this repository for now, since I am not planning to update it

# :warning: The devs of among us updated the anticheat of the game, most of the cheats are not working anymore. I'm working on a way to find new cheats and fix the old ones.

## About the client

## :warning: This client is NOT a virus, it is detected as one for most of antivirus because of the injector and the methods used in the files. If you don't trust me read the code by yourself.

## :warning: Make sure you use the correct version of the client depending of the version of your game.

## :warning: Post issues about features not working ONLY if they are not listed as 'not working' in the features part.

## Downloading the client

### Before downloading, make sure you looked the [Supported Versions](https://github.com/Escartem/AmongUsCheatClient#Supported-versions) to know what to download

#### Latest versions

- [0.0.3-beta2](https://github.com/Escartem/AmongUsCheatClient/releases/tag/0.0.3-beta2)
- [0.0.2](https://github.com/Escartem/AmongUsCheatClient/releases/tag/0.0.2)

#### Please note that releases are not created as often as dll build, if you want to get the latests features, I reccomend downloading the dll file and injecting it yourself

---

## Using the client

1. Extract zip file in a folder

2. Start AmongUs

3. Run the `AmongUsCheatClient.exe` file

4. A console should spawn saying further instructions

#### If you get an error, make sure to follow the steps that could fix the error before posting an issue

---

## Building the dll file

The client was created in Visual Studio 2019, to edit and compile your own version, get the project located in **AmongUsCheatClient-22s**.
Then compile the project as **Release - x86**

---

## Using the command line

The injector and the main file support command line.

### For the injector, here is the cmd instructions

```bash
Injector.exe --process-name "Among Us.exe" --inject DLL_PATH
```

DLL_PATH being the absolute path of the dll file, for example `F:\Docs\AUCC.dll`

### For the main file, you can use this

```bash
python main.py --dev
```

This will start the client using the dll file located in **AmongUsCheatClient-22s\Release\AUCC.dll** assuming the project is in the same location as the master branch
